 This project is a text based adveture game I made using python. I learned python in my computer science intro class so I used the skills I learned to make a game during winter break.

### Project 2

#### Description:
 This project is a copy of the game "Buckshot Roulette" I made using python. I made this project after I saw YouTube videos of people playing the game online and I wanted to see if I could recreate it on my own using python.

 This project is a basic drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you click on the images they make the corresponding sounds. I made this project to showcase my basic skills using these three languages.
