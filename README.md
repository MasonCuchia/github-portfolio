# Mason Cuchia's Portfolio
 
## About Me
I have taken Computer Science classes every year since my freshman year in high school. I have used Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and I am learning C++ now. I started off my college career at Eastern New Mexico University, where I played division 2 baseball. After my freshman year in college I transfered to Texas State University where I will attend my upcoming sophmore year. There I will pursue a degree in Computer Science and I will graduate in 2027. I am excited to continue learning about the different areas of Computer Science and expanding my knowledge.

## Projects
All of these projects are my own creations and were made using VS Code.

### Project 1

#### Description:
 This project is a text-based adveture game I made using python. I learned python in my computer science intro class so I used the skills I learned to make a game during winter break.

### Project 2

#### Description:
 This project is a copy of the game "Buckshot Roulette" I made using python. I made this project after I saw YouTube videos of people playing the game online and I wanted to see if I could recreate it in a text-based game on my own.

### Project 3

#### Description:
 This project is a basic drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you click on the images they make the corresponding sounds. I made this project to showcase my basic skills using these three languages.
