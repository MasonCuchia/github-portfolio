## About Me
I started off my college career at Eastern New Mexico University, where I played division 2 baseball my freshman year. After that I transfered to Texas State University where I will attend my upcoming sophmore year. There I will pursue a degree in Computer Science and I am planning to graduate in 2027.  


## Projects

### Project 1

#### Description:
 This project is a text based adveture game I made using python. I learned python in my computer science intro class so I used the skills I learned to make a game during winter break.

### Project 2

#### Description:
 This project is a copy of the game "Buckshot Roulette" I made using python. I made this game after I saw YouTube videos of people playing the game and I wanted to see if I could recreate it using python.

### All of these projects are for fun and are in attempt to help me get better at coding
