## About Me
I am a Computer Science major at Texas State University and I am currently a Sophmore. I just recently finished my freshman year at Eastern New Mexico University where I studied and played Division 2 baseball. 

## Projects

### Project 1

#### Description
 This project is a text based adveture game I made using python. I learned python in my computer science intro class so I used the skills I learned to make a game during winter break.
